## DNS Zone Transfer using dnsenum tool

dnsenum is a tool that is used for DNS zone enumeration and information gathering. It can perform various types of DNS queries to gather information about a domain, such as DNS records, subdomains, and IP addresses. One of its features is the ability to perform a DNS zone transfer, which is a way to obtain a copy of the entire DNS zone file from a DNS server. This can be useful for reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment purposes.
